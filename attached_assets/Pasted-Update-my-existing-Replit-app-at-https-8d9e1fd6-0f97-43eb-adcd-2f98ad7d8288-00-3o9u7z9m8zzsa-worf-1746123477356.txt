   - Ensure interactive filters/charts function correctly.

3. **📦 Supply Chain Page**
   - Add responsive **"Add Supplier"** button → Navigates to a form page.
   - Each supplier row should have a **View** button → Opens detail view with:
     - Profile section
     - **SAQ (Self Assessment Questionnaire)** tab — include all fields/sections as in the reference.
   - Supplier detail page should include working tabs and responsive layout.

4. **📂 Compliance Page**
   - Match metrics display, layout, and styling.
   - Nest **EUDR Declarations** under this menu.

5. **📋 EUDR Declarations Page**
   - Include two tabs:
     - **Inbound Declarations**
     - **Outbound Declarations**
   - Each has its own table layout, filter controls, and action buttons.
   - "Add Declaration" button opens a form page.
   - Forms should be responsive and functional.
   - Ensure pagination, status tags, and row actions work and match the reference.

6. **👥 Customers Page**
   - Add **"Add Company"** button — opens responsive form page.
   - Table should show: Company Name, Industry, Score.
   - View/Edit/Delete buttons must work and look identical to reference.

7. **⚙️ Settings Page**

   - Make dropdown fully styled and responsive.

9. **🌍 Internationalization**
   - Implement i18n using `next-i18next`:
     - All visible UI text must use translation keys.
     - Provide translation files (`en.json`, `fr.json`).
   - Add working language switcher in the top bar.

10. **📱 Responsiveness & Functionality**
   - All buttons (Add Supplier, Add Company, Add Declaration) must:
     - Be responsive
     - Trigger navigation or modal actions
     - Link to proper forms or tabs
   - All forms must validate fields, look good on mobile, and be styled with Tailwind.

11. **🧠 Bonus**
   - Match color scheme, font size, padding, and whitespace exactly to the reference.
   - Ensure proper scroll areas for tables and nested sections.
   - Tabs (like SAQ and Inbound/Outbound) should remember state if possible.
